Basic features for 1st run:
 - Add to a list of tasks
 - Mark tasks as completed
 - Estimated and Actual effort values for tasks
 - 'Reward' system for tasks
Effort Values:
 - Estimated Value is assigned by user when creating a task
 - Actual Value is assigned by user after finishing a task
 - The greater of these two values would be used to determine the 'Reward'
Reward:
 - Probably just useless points for now. Worked for Reddit.
Good sorting metadata:
 - Date Created
 - Date Completed
 - Estimated Difficulty
 - Completed Difficulty


 FUTURE STUFF:
  - Remember tasks, autofill names, show previous average effort values.
